Overview of the data

The PAD-UFES-20 dataset contains 26 columns, and 2299 rows which adds up to a total of 59,748 entries not including the column names. There are a total of 10,484 missing values which makes up for 17.54% of all entries. It is worth to note, that out of the 26 columns, 11 has exactly 804 missing values, which suggests that 804 lesions donâ€™t have most of the background information. We can count 1,641 unique lesion ids, but only 1,373 unique patient ids, so we can conclude that some patients have multiple lesions registered.
