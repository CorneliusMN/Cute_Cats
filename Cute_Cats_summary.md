Overview of the data

The PAD-UFES-20 dataset contains 26 columns, and 2299 rows which adds up to a total of 59,748 entries not including the column names. There are a total of 10,484 missing values which makes up for 17.54% of all entries. It is worth to note, that out of the 26 columns, 11 has exactly 804 missing values, which suggests that 804 lesions don’t have most of the background information. We can count 1,641 unique lesion ids, but only 1,373 unique patient ids, so we can conclude that some patients have multiple lesions registered.

Diagnostics

BCC - Basal Cell Carcinoma 
BCC is the most common form of skin cancer. It occurs due to DNA damage caused by exposure to UV radiation. “BCC can look like open sores, red patches, pink growths, shiny bumps, scars or growths”, although it varies greatly from person to person.

SCC - Squamous Cell Carcinoma
SCC is the second most common skin cancer and like the BCC it is caused by exposure to UV radiation. “SCC can appear like scaly red patches, open sores, rough, thickened or wart-like skin or growths with central depressions.” Compared to BCC, SCC tends to be bigger in dimensions, and more aggressively spreading.

ACK - Actinic Keratosis
ACK is the most common precancer which forms on skin that has been exposed to extensive UV radiation. “AKs usually appear as small dry, scaly or crusty patches of skin. They may be red, light or dark tan, white, pink, skin color or a combination of all the former”. As such ACK can be hard to determine based on look alone and can in most cases actually be easier to determine based on feel.

SEK - Seborrheic Keratosis
SEK are skin tumors on the outer layer of the skin, however they are non-cancerous and do not require treatment in most cases. They usually appear as light brown or dark marks and have well defined edges in most cases, which helps differentiate them. In some cases microscopic evaluation is required to determine it.
